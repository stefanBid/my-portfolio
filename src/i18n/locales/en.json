Imbriani State High School</strong> in Avellino, Italy, where I graduated in <strong>July 2018</strong>. Opting for <em>Applied Sciences</em> was a pivotal decision, as it allowed me to deeply explore <strong>mathematics</strong>, <strong>physics</strong>, and <strong>biology</strong>—subjects that honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities. This preparation laid the groundwork for my subsequent university experience at the <strong>University of Salerno</strong> in Fisciano, where I earned a <strong>Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science</strong> in <strong>December 2022</strong>. During my university journey, I had the opportunity to fully immerse myself in the field of <strong>computer science</strong>, tackling in-depth studies on <strong>programming</strong>, <strong>algorithms</strong>, <strong>operating systems</strong>, and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>. These studies not only reinforced my passion but also broadened my perspective on the capabilities of <strong>software development</strong> and how <strong>technology</strong> can be used to improve everyday life. The combination of <em>theory and practice</em>, through <em>projects and laboratories</em>, was crucial in developing my <strong>technical skills</strong> and the ability to practically apply the knowledge acquired. Choosing to pursue this career was a natural evolution of my <em>interest</em> and <em>curiosity</em> towards the digital world, pushing me to continuously <strong>explore</strong> and <strong>innovate</strong> in this dynamic and ever-evolving field.",

During this period, I acquired skills in developing <strong>distributed applications</strong>, mastering both <strong>back-end</strong> and <strong>front-end</strong> technologies. This experience allowed me to utilize modern and highly demanded technologies in the market, refining my <strong>technical abilities</strong> in a stimulating and dynamic environment. Upon completing my internship, I was hired as a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> by the same company in <strong>March 2023</strong>, a role I continue to hold today. Transitioning from an intern to a full member of the <strong>development team</strong> gave me the opportunity to further deepen my knowledge and <strong>technical skills</strong>, working on more complex and challenging projects. Although the role of a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> requires good versatility across different technologies and frameworks, my passion and main goal remain focused on <strong>front-end development</strong>. I am continually seeking opportunities to excel in this area, convinced that the <em>user interface</em> is not just a matter of <em>aesthetics</em> but a crucial point of contact that defines the <strong>end-user experience</strong>. My aspiration is to become a reference point in the field of <strong>front-end</strong>, bringing continuous <strong>innovation</strong> and <strong>improvements</strong> to the projects I work on. In this journey, my passion for <strong>computer science</strong> continues to guide me towards new <strong>challenges</strong> and <strong>achievements</strong>, with the goal of excelling in every aspect of my work while maintaining a clear focus on the specialization that most excites me.",
